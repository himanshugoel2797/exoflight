[Vandenberg]
owner=U.S.
ll=344000N 1203000W
desc=Vandenberg's location on the coast of northern California makes it possible to easily launch satellites into polar orbit, unlike the Kennedy Space Center. This, along with its location relative to the jet stream, makes Vandenberg a good site to launch reconnaissance satellites. Its nickname is "VandyLand".

[Wallops Island]

[Baikonur]
owner=Russia
ll=474800N 655000E
desc=The Baikonur Cosmodrome, also called Tjuratam, is the world's oldest and largest operational space launch facility. The original Baikonur is a mining town a few hundred kilometres northeast -- the launch site was given this name to cause confusion and keep the location secret. This town was specifically chosen because the flight path of the rockets that launched many Soviet satellites, including the first Sputnik, passed over its vicinity.

[Plesetsk]

[Svobodny]
owner=Russia
ll=513000N 1383000E
desc=Svobodny is a Russian rocket launch site located on the border with China. Originally constructed as a launch site for ICBMs, it was planned as a replacement for Baikonur Cosmodrome, which became a foreign territory after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the development was not finished because of financial difficulties.

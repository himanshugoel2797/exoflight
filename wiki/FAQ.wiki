=== What do I do with this? ===

The best way to get started is to try the Gemini Missions (Ctrl-N). These are four missions that take you through the phases of launch, interception, docking, and reentry. You could also try the `File | Custom Mission` (the menu pops down from the top in Windows) to place a spaceship at an arbitrary location in the Solar System and mess around. We are working on better support for free-form missions (just need the documentation really) so stay tuned.

If you're astrodynamically-inclined, you could also take a shot at making custom missions with the [http://code.google.com/p/exoflight/wiki/SequencerLanguage Exoflight Sequencer Language] -- see the `missions` and `programs` directory for detailed (the source code may help here until we get all this doc'ed)

=== I don't see files automatically getting downloaded after startup. ===

If you are behind a proxy your best bet is to download them manually. Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/exoflight/downloads/list Downloads] tab and download all the .zip files with the "Required" tag. Then unzip them all to the `C:\Program Files\Exoflight` directory (on Windows) or the `Exoflight.app/Contents/Resources` directory (Mac OS X).

=== I don't see an Exoflight shortcut in the Start Menu, just the Uninstaller. ===

This is a problem with Windows XP and version 0.1.2, it will be fixed. In the meantime just start `C:\Program Files\Exoflight\Exoflight.exe` manually.

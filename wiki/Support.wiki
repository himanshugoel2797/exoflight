== I don't see files automatically getting downloaded after startup. ==

If you are behind a proxy your best bet is to download them manually. Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/exoflight/downloads/list Downloads] tab and download all the .zip files with the "Required" tag. Then unzip them all to the `C:\Program Files\Exoflight` directory (on Windows) or the `Exoflight.app/Contents/Resources` directory (Mac OS X).

Features I'd like:

== Missions ==
 * Apollo
 * Shuttle
 * space probes (Voyager, Pathfinder, Cassini/Hyugens, etc)

Add more satellites ("air traffic") depending on era

Easier navigation between planets
 * Visualization on trajectories
 * Gravity assist optimization

== Simulation ==
Improve integrator behavior

Improve atmospheric simulation

Better guidance controls

== Graphics ==
Add normal mapping to planets and advanced shaders

More models

More advanced terrain confabulation

Volume rendering of clouds/atmosphere

Better atmospheric refraction simulation

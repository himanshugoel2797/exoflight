desc=The Jupiter C launched the U.S.'s first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958 -- more than four months after Sputnik. Its first stage was based on the Redstone, a short-range nuclear missile. It first flew in 1956, but with a dummy fourth stage to prevent it from achieving orbit. This was in order to avoid overflying the USSR's territory with a military rocket, which would have created an international incident.

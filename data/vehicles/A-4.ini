desc=The A-4 began as the V-2, a German rocket used as a ballistic weapon during World War II. The brainchild of Werther Von Braun, Germany's premier "rocket scientist", the V-2 was the first practical liquid-fueled rocket.  After the war, all remaining V-2 parts were confiscated by the U.S. military. The rocket was then redesignated the A-4, and with the help of Von Braun and his team, used as a research rocket in the U.S.

[Gemini 6 Launch]
desc=The objective of the Gemini 6 mission is to launch, rendezvous with an unmanned Agena module, and return safely to Earth.  The first step is to launch the Gemini spacecraft aboard a Titan-2 rocket. This phase is automatic, so all you must do is monitor the flight path and make sure nothing goes wrong. At the end of the 7-minute burn, you will be in a 160 x 270 km orbit around the Earth.

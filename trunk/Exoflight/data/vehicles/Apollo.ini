desc=The Apollo spacecraft was designed as part of the Apollo Program, by the United States in the early 1960s to land men on the moon before 1970 and return them safely to earth. This goal was set forth by President Kennedy after the first flight of the Mercury Space Program.

desc=The Command/Service Module (CSM), built for NASA by North American Aviation, was one of the two spacecraft utilized for the Apollo program to land astronauts on the Moon. The command module houses the crew and the equipment needed for re-entry and splashdown, and the service module provides propulsion, electrical power and storage for various consumables required during a mission.

desc=The Apollo Lunar Module was built for the US Apollo program by Grumman to achieve the transit from moon orbit to the surface and back. The module was also known as the LM from the manufacturer designation (yet pronounced "LEM" from NASA's early name for it, Lunar Excursion Module). It was the only component of the Apollo/Saturn system never to suffer a significant failure.

desc=Saturn IB was the first manned rocket of the Apollo program, launching Apollo 7 into orbit for a checkout of the Command and Service Modules. It also launched three Skylab flights, and the U.S. half of the Apollo-Soyuz project. Its 2nd stage is also used as the 3rd stage of the massive Saturn V. The first stage consists of propellant tanks from Redstone and Jupiter rockets.

desc=The Saturn V is the largest rocket ever built and the first to send men to the moon. It stands 36 stories high, twice as tall as the Space Shuttle stack on its pad. The first stage's massive F-1 engines consume 5 tons of propellant per second, generating 160,000,000 horsepower. The Saturn V was the workhorse of the Apollo program, launching 11 total missions, including Skylab.

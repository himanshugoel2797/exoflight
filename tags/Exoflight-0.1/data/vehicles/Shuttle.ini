[Space Shuttle]
desc=The Space Shuttle (or STS, Space Transportation System) is the first partially-reusable manned spacecraft.  It ascends to orbit like a rocket, and lands on a runway like a glider.  Its Candian-built robot arm allows it to perform many satellite rescue and repair operations, as well as assemble the ISS.

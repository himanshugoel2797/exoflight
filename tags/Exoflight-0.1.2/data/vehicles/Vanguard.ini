desc=The Vanguard was designed to launch America's first satellite during the International Geophysical Year, 1957. However, it did not. The first Vanguard launch, two months after Sputnik, resulted in a fiery disaster on the pad. Vanguard finally launched a grapefruit-sized satellite into orbit on March 17, 1958. This satellite remains in orbit today, the oldest human artifact in space.
